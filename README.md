# House Price Predictor
In this project, we built models to predict the price of properties in the city of Paris. We used data from a curated dataset on Kaggle, which contained information about properties sold in Paris as well as their features and amenities. 

We performed exploratory data analysis to understand the data and prepare it for modeling. We then trained and evaluated five different models: 
- Multiple Linear Regression,
- Random Forest Regression,
- Support Vector Regression,
- Neural Network Regression,
- Gradient Boosting Regression.

We compared the models based on the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. We concluded that the Multiple Linear Regression model is the best fit for the data, followed by the Random Forest Regression model and the Gradient Boosting Regression model, which are all highly accurate and are or average off by less than 1%. The Neural Network Regression model also gives good results, with an average error of less than 10%. However, the Support Vector Regression model is not very accurate but gives reasonable results, with an average error of more than 20%.
